    "Ford–Fulkerson algorithm (FFA) is a greedy algorithm that computes the maximum flow in a flow network.\n",
    "The idea behind the algorithm is as follows: as long as there is a path from the source (start node) to the sink (end node),\n",
    "with available capacity on all edges in the path, we send flow along one of the paths. Then we find another path, and so on.\n",
    "The sum of the flows from each path gives us the maximum flow of the network.\n",
    "\n",
    "Augmenting Path\n",
    "It is the path available in a flow network.\n",
    "\n",
    "Residual Graph\n",
    "Imagine if we could look back at the choices we’ve made and undo some of our earlier flow decisions\n",
    "We’ll basically take our existing graph and update the capacities of all the regular edges to be the \n",
    "current remaining capacity (ce - fe). We’ll then add back edges indicating the amount of flow currently\n",
    "going across this edge. We can then use that back edge to decrease flow in order to try out alternate flow allocations. \n",
    "\n",
    "Residual Capacity\n",
    "It is the capacity of the edge after subtracting the flow from the maximum capacity.\n",

    "Ford-Fulkerson Algorithm \n",
    "\n",
    "The following is simple idea of Ford-Fulkerson algorithm:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Start with initial flow as 0.\n",
    "2. While there is a augmenting path from source to sink. \n",
    "3. Add this path-flow to flow.\n",
    "4. Return flow.\n",
